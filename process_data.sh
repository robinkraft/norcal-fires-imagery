# Use gdalbuildvrt to create a virtual raster (VRT) from the raw data.
# This makes it easy to process all the files at once because theyâ€™re treated as a single file.
# Also, there's a limit of 15 tilesets on a map style, so for a large number of images a mosaic is a must.
# Side note: VRTs are evaluated lazily, in that nothing happens to the data until you export to a "real" raster file.
# So build up a few different options, then run them all at once at the end.
# Also: VRTs are so cool!

# This makes tiling faster to avoid Mapbox's 2h timeout for tiling large images.

# The raw files from DG are HUGE - 1 gb each because they use very inefficient internal compression, if any at all.
# This command uses more efficient compression and a more effective photometric interpretation (not sure what that is really - I was just using Stack Overflow :)
# Otherwise gdal_translate will take literally days for a large set of large images.

# must preprocess files.txt to make individual files w/filenames in them
# e.g. 1.txt contains the first 5 filenames
# recommended so that mapbox tiling can happen in parallel without
# tons of tilesets that can't all be used on a single map


# this files.txt happened to split into 8 groups of ~5 filenames.
# process each one individually
# 1. Making vrt just simplifies things a bit by defining a web mercator mosaic.
# 2. Warp the input files, with proper internal compression. Much faster
# processing this way since file sizes are much smaller than otherwise.
# 3. Use Mapbox's upload API to kick off processing into tiles
